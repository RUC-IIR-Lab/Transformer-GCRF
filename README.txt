We have provided the code of our model and the results performed on Chinese SMS dataset as:
1. train_v4.py:  the training process of our model
2. model_v4.py: the framework of our Transformer-GCRF
3. decode_sc.py: the decode process of GCRF
4. ntransformer.py: the transformer structure
5. results of Chinese SMS.txt: the results of Transformer-GCRF on SMS dataset.
The code should be run based on Tensorflow.
